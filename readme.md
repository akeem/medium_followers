A quick and dirty script:

I wanted to see if it was possible to pull medium followers for a given
user and it was listed in the medium api.

This is pretty much a pluck from one of the XHR calls that the web app
makes.

So how do I uses this?

```
python get_followers.py <username> <page>
```

Of course, this code comes without warranty.
